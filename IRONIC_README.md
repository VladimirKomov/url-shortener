🔗 URL Shortener — but make it microservices
A pet project where a "simple" URL shortener spiraled into a distributed system with trust issues, async dreams, and Kafka-induced conversations.

🧱 Tech Stack
FastAPI – async Python, because the pain should be fast.

PostgreSQL + Redis – one remembers everything, the other forgets instantly.

Kafka – so microservices can overshare their emotions.

MongoDB – a journal of suspicious links.

Google Safe Browsing API – moral compass and digital doorman.

Node.js (incoming) – a stats microservice to count clicks, browsers, and existential dread.

Kubernetes (on the horizon) – because chaos must be orchestrated.

🎯 Features (So Far)
/shorten and /go endpoints

Asynchronous URL validation

Kafka, Redis, and MongoDB are all on speaking terms

Dockerized – and not actively on fire

It technically works... but only in my local hell

Frontend is still being imagined

CI/CD is currently “CI… someday”

🛠 Planned
Node.js analytics microservice (to spy on usage metrics like a nerdy NSA)

CI/CD setup (if I don’t flee into the woods first)

Kubernetes deployment – because YAML is a lifestyle

React frontend – eventually, maybe, one day

🧘‍♂️ What I’ve Learned
Microservices are like teenagers: independent, loud, and constantly yelling at each other through Kafka

Redis lies to your face – but it lies fast

“URL shortener” sounds simple... until you build it like a low-budget Netflix backend

(If it loads, that’s already a win.)

I'm not just shortening URLs — I'm lengthening my resume and extending the number of technologies I can suffer through.
