🧪 Started a pet project: a URL shortener, but make it microservices and anxiety. Everything hurts, and that’s the architecture.

🎬 Title: “FastAPI & Kafka: Into the Abyss”

🧩 Tech Stack:

FastAPI — because Flask is for the sane, and I chose suffering.

PostgreSQL + Redis — the classic duo: one forgets nothing, the other forgets everything too quickly.

Kafka — so my services can scream into the void and hope someone’s listening.

MongoDB — the emotional journal for suspicious URLs.

Google Safe Browsing — our spiritual guide and URL bouncer.

🐙 Architecture in a nutshell: — User submits a URL.
— I don’t trust it. Kafka doesn’t either.
— The URL gets validated by a microservice that reads too much Google documentation.
— Redis pretends it remembers things.
— MongoDB records the moral failings of the link.

⚙️ Project status: — It technically works... but only in my local hell.
— Frontend is still being imagined.
— CI/CD is currently “CI… someday”.

🧘‍♂️ What I’ve learned: — Microservices are like teenagers: independent but constantly yelling at each other through Kafka.
— Redis lies to your face, but it lies fast.
— “URL shortener” sounds simple until you build it like a low-budget Netflix backend.
